        <p>26 year-old developer; based in Dallas, Texas</p>
        <!--'Developer' section of the article. gave it an 'id' incase I want
        to link to it later on.-->

          <hr style="border: double black">
            <p>Throughout my exposure to the industry & in practicing the skill, software development has evolved to take on many forms & meanings, depending on the context. Primarily, as an art form, software development has shown me how people from <i>any</i> background can come together to create; simply from the desire to express a common vision.</p>
            <!--'div' container, classed as "box". made to hold the unordered-list
            seen on the page.-->
            <div class="box">
              <!--unordered-list... really only here for the sake of it, i mean really.-->

                <li>Applications</li>

                <li>Services</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
            <p>All of these things, & beyond, are made possible because of the skillsets & opportunities of people like you & I. & while the same could be said of industries outside of technology, no other group has reached a scope of influence nearly as vast as ours.</p>
        </div>
        <!--second horizontal rule, mentioned above-->

        <!--'About Me' section; also has an 'id' for linking later-->
        <div id="About-Me">
          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Outside of software development, my focus expands to psychology, fps games, social philosophy, & film study.</p>
          <p>Understanding how our minds, social structures, & even culturally impactful films, work has led me down a lot of interesting paths that reveal more about humanity, & its own path, than most of us truly realize; in terms of predicting trends, creating lasting friendships, & knowing where & how to shift yourself, & organizations, in the greater context.</p>
